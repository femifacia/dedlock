# Dedlock

## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to implement a **lockscreen** with dedsec theme.
When you launch the **dedlock** binary, your screen is locked until you type your password followed by ENTER.
Don't wait for a fancy prompt to appear and tell you the number of character typed.

Just enter your password to unlock the screen

**Warning**

This project is not finished. We are looking for a low level way to maintain the top level frame before
adding other UI elements.
